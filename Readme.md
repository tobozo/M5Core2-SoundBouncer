# M5Core2-SoundBouncer

[![Pendulum Wave](img/bouncer.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUc0wJBElTs)


## What is it?

An implementation of [Project JDM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHAiieQmQBS38_AUkPf-7iQ)'s [16 metronomes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH03ZJaNe8A).

This demo for M5Core2 takes advantage of DMA transfer for both the
display and the audio while demonstrating synchronization with
incremented visual and auditory rhythms.

The code does not simulate physics but is still valid to show
the interation between period and pendulum length when starting
multiple metronomes simultaneously.
